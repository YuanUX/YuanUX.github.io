          <h3>Introduction</h3>
          <p>
            We were challenged by our Client Sherwin Williams to redesign the
            PRO+ APP within 1 and a half months. It includes implementing the
            latest design system, reorganizing Information architecture, and
            adding new e-commerce and project management functionality. PRO+ is
            the name for our registered professional painter customer, they
            create 90% of the Sherwin Williams sales, and e-commerce will be an
            important growth point for the business.

        <h1>
          How might we help Sherwin PROs shop from their mobile phone and
          enhance brand loyalty.

      <p>
        As many homeowners or property managers will hire a contractor to do
        their project, pro is also the people who choose products and buy
        products for the project they are doing. 90% of our sales used to come
        from that professional customer. Sherwin-Williams provides special
        offers and many other tools to help them with their job. Those customers
        are relatively slow in adopting technologies, they call their stores and
        do many things face to face. Meanwhile, there are also increasingly more
        young people stepping into this new industry, they have a totally
        different mindset in running their business.

        <h3>Heuristic Evaluation</h3>
        <h1>What caused the low-adoption rate of the existing APP?</h1>
        <p>
          I did a quick heuristic evaluation of this app, it is usable but
          definitely not user-friendly. According to my evaluation, what I heard
          from users and stakeholders, I identified three main aspects that we
          need to work on in this new version.

      <p>
        We may think the painting Pro's main job is painting the walls, but
        that's not necessarily true. Apart from painting, they spend much of
        their time getting new clients bidding for projects and doing overall
        management. Not only Sherwin, but many of our competitors also wanted to
        provide premiums service that helps them with all the other jobs. That's
        an important differentiator for the business and leads to many projects
        we have been working on.

          We have a lot to achieve in this project. We wanted to be focused and
          deliver sooner but also do not want to lose any great thoughts.
          Firstly I lead a brainstorming session with stakeholders to list all
          the features we want to have, regardless of the effort it will take.
          Then, I guided people to prioritize, what to achieve now, near, and
          future - so we have a clear road map that helps us all be on the same
          page. Taking all the ideas and features from the brainstorming and
          some regular features that we need for a typical Ecomm app, I quickly
          made this high-level Information architecture. That helped us all have
          a clear view of what we are designing and be able to divide and
          conquer.

          Since the key role of this app is to help users shop Sherwin's
          products. I thought about the end-to-end flow since the beginning. I
          love to build prototypes even with lo-fi wires and let people try them
          rather than just look at them. Even it is just a very early stage
          wireframe, it convinces people with some valuable features: Account QR
          code, Guest Cart, Account Dash, and the general APP structures.

          stores. That is why we prioritize the three tile buttons and store
          information. Many PROs don't know Sherwin also provided many other
          products other than paints, so I put all the categories at the end for

            When I designed this shop flow. The key success factor is to make it
            extremely easy and to reduce clicks:
          </p>
          <p>
            1. Coupon: rather than having PROs manually input coupon codes, I
            recommended showing available offers while users are checking out.
            Pros really like this little feature.
          </p>
          <img alt="Git Bash" src="../assets/img/pro/coupon.png" width="70%" />
          <br />
          <p>
            2. Agree and pay: We used to have a separate step for users to check
            "Agree on Terms". While researching other applications, I found it
            common to combine this two-step, this is then well accepted by the
            legal team.

            I created fully clickable prototypes to help engineers to navigate

            I teach engineers to inspect components in Figma. For details that
            aren't apparent, I write annotations and provide user flows to
            further explain.

            Q&A tickets in Jira.
