          <h3>Introduction</h3>
          <p>
            The global pandemic has accelerated digital transformation in
            Sherwin Williams and pushed the business to reach its customer in a
            never-happened way. Virtual color consultation is a new service for
            those DIYers to find the color they want and for Sherwin to find
            growth through digital channels. This service serves 80% of
            first-time customers, and their average order value is twice as many
            others.
          </p>

        <h3>User Needs</h3>
        <h1>Color is fun but can be overwhelming.</h1>
      </div>

      <img alt="Git Bash" src="../assets/img/vcc/user.jpeg" width="100%" />
      <p>
        Sherwin-Williams provides 3000+ colors that you can choose from. That's
        awesome but also are way too many options for a single person to choose
        from. We deeply understood DIYers' need for color guidance and provides
        many self-service color tools under the Color Snap brand. However, the
        human-to-human interaction is always warmer and more efficient that we
        never want to lose.
      </p>

      <p>
        These days, people cannot walk directly into Sherwin store and talk to
        our store members as usual, but they still need to be able to connect
        with an expert on their terms who can guide them in translating what’s
        “in their head,” validating their choices and helping them “see it” in
        their space so they can make a final color decision. It becomes
        extremely important for us to connect with our customers online.

        <h3>Business Needs</h3>
        <h1>
          Guide DIY customers end-to-end from Inspiration to completed projects
          beyond the store.
        </h1>
      </div>

      <img alt="Git Bash" src="../assets/img/vcc/business.png" width="100%" />
      <p>
        Beyond just helping choose color, DIYers usually do the project for the
        first time. Inspiration, color samples, comparing products - there is a
        lot that our consultant can do. Through this project, we provide a
        best-in-class virtual color and paint consultation experience that helps
        DIYers choose paint for their projects because extending S-W’s trademark
        expertise and personalized support beyond the store can inspire more
        people to tackle their projects with S-W.

          <h1>
            How might we offer a more personalized, confidence-building, and
            action-inspiring consultation experience?
          </h1>
        </div>

        <p>
          In order to quickly hit the market, we have little time to do the
          research, so we decided to have a co-creation workshop with DIYers,
          color consultants, and other Sherwin employees to understand the
          needs, goals, and constraints. Since that workshop, we got clearer
          what an ideal experience should be, but the goal should be achieved
          step by step.

          <h3>First Release</h3>
          <h1>
            An end-to-end service where users can easily request a consultation,
            meet with consultants and get tailored color and project
            recommendations.
          </h1>
        </div>

        <p>
          For the first release, we used a few out-of-shelf solutions like
          Microsoft Booking, Teams, and Sherwin Color Visualizer. That
          definitely isn't the "ideal states" from a UX perspective, but from
          the business perspective, the real goal of this release is to meet
          customers as soon as we can and to see how they will react. A few
          months later we already knew how much the customers love the service.
          The success encourages Sherwin to invest more, bring the service to a
          larger scale, and take the whole experience to the next level.

        <p>
          I found that users can easily understand what virtual color
          consultation is and what they want to do on this landing page is to
          submit their requests. So I chose the option with higher information
          density. Users don't need to scroll down to know what they can do but
          understand at the first glance. I also broke the form into two steps -
          contact information and project information, so that users will not be
          overwhelmed by the text fields they need to finish.

          Helping people choose the right color is important, equally important
          is to keep the connection and to offer more. So I designed the simple
          login modal. Using the information they already filled in, just add
          one more step to set up the password. I referred to the existing login
          page and redesigned that with our new DIY language while fixing some
          existing usability issues.

        The quick launch helped us learn a lot especially how much people love
        this new service, so we want to scale this success. I have been
        researching and designing the consultant and admin experience. We will
        automate most manual work for the consultants, build the data pipeline
        for real-time scheduling and lead generation. For DIYers, they can get
        consultation right away, play with color in the project space, go back
        to their consultant, and buy products in one click.

          In this project, I got the experience of working on a large-scale

          how much can a consultant provide during a 30 minutes consultation. As
          a designer, I constantly consider what their talent is and what we can
          optimize, so we can provide the right tools that
          facilitate human-to-human interactions and help customers achieve
          their goals, and build trust for our brand.

            Real-time scheduling is the capabilities we envisioned from day one.
            It will drastically shorten customers' waiting time, relieve the
            admin's from manual assigning work, enable the service to expand to
            a larger scale, save consultants time in logistics... However, that
            means investment and internal workflow shifts.
          </p>

          <p>
            With the great success from the last release, our efforts
            demonstrate the value, and most importantly many stakeholders' hard
            work. real-time scheduling and project integration is coming true!
